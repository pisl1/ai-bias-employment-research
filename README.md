# AI Bias in Employment Decision-Making

## Research Question
How do physical biases in artificial intelligence systems, such as age and disability bias, impact employment decisions, and are these biases inherent to AI or introduced through human-designed data and systems?

## Background
This project originated as an honors-level literature review examining how large language models and AI-powered applicant tracking systems can reflect and amplify bias in hiring, promotion, and termination decisions. The research synthesizes findings on gender, age, racial, and disability bias in AI systems.

## Current Work
- Completed a comprehensive literature review on AI bias in employment contexts
- Identified gaps in research related to elderly and disabled workers
- Designed a proposed empirical study using prompt-based evaluation of large language models

## Next Steps
- Conduct controlled prompt-based testing using comparable candidate profiles
- Record and analyze AI decision patterns
- Evaluate whether bias appears systematically across age and disability variables
